# Automated-Valuation-Model-for-predicting-Dublin-housing-properties

<p align="justify"> In this project, we predict the dublin housing prices Median Percentage Error.

We followed a traditional ML pipeline, wherein firstly we did Exploratory Data Analysis, then going towards Feature Engineering and Selection and finally ML modelling and comparison of scores in the end.

We trained and tested around more than 10 Regression models and found out that Cat Boost is the best algorithm with less MdPE and MdAPE percentages.

We further tuned the Cat Boost Algo and found out that the tuned Cat Boost is outperforming each and every other algorithm, it is also satisfying and beating the given accuracy results.  </p>
